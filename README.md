A phishing website detection system using machine learning 
algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multilayer perceptronâ€™s (MLP). 
The system extracts a set of features from websites and uses these features to train 
SVM and MLP models to classify websites as phishing or legitimate. The system is 
evaluated on a dataset of over 11,000 phishing and legitimate websites, and it 
achieves an accuracy of over 99%. It is a significant contribution to the field of 
phishing website detection, and it can be used to help protect users from phishing 
attacks.
